# passVault - a Slack App

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This program was built to learn how to create and deploy a Slack App. This is a temporary project to lay the foundations for a much more useful feature, but for now it will act as an interactive password database to store complicated passwords. 

The motivation behind this project is to use Slack as a ready-made frontend (a command terminal in your pocket) that can be accessed on both mobile and desktop with a Slack Account. The app is hosted on Heroku to complement this idea.
